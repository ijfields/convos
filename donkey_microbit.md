Sure, I'd be happy to help you design a donkey car based on the micro:bit!
Here is a list of parts you will need:
<li>Micro:bit board</li><li>Micro:bit edge connector breakout board</li><li>Motor driver board (L9110S H-bridge)</li><li>2 x DC motors</li><li>2 x wheels</li><li>Battery pack (4 x AA batteries)</li><li>Jumper wires</li><li>Chassis (can be 3D printed or sourced from a kit)</li>
Here are some suggested sources for these parts:
<li>Micro:bit board and edge connector breakout board: You can buy these from various online stores such as Amazon, Adafruit, and SparkFun.</li><li>Motor driver board (L9110S H-bridge): You can find this on various online stores such as Amazon or Adafruit.</li><li>DC motors and wheels: These can also be found on various online stores such as Amazon, Adafruit, and SparkFun.</li><li>Battery pack: You can find these on Amazon or your local electronics store.</li><li>Jumper wires: These can be found on Amazon or your local electronics store.</li><li>Chassis: You can either 3D print your own chassis or purchase a pre-made kit. There are many different designs available online.</li>
Instructions:
<li><p>First, assemble the chassis according to the instructions provided. This will likely involve attaching the motors to the chassis and securing the wheels to the motor shafts.</p></li><li><p>Next, connect the motor driver board to the micro:bit edge connector breakout board using jumper wires. The motor driver board should be connected to pins 0, 1, 2, and 8 on the breakout board.</p></li><li><p>Connect the DC motors to the motor driver board using jumper wires. Make sure that the polarity is correct.</p></li><li><p>Connect the battery pack to the micro:bit edge connector breakout board using jumper wires. The battery pack should be connected to the 3V and GND pins on the breakout board.</p></li><li><p>Finally, upload the Donkey Car code to the micro:bit board. You can find the code on the official Donkey Car GitHub repository.</p></li>
Troubleshooting tips:
<li>If the motors aren't moving, check to make sure that the jumper wires are connected correctly and that the motor driver board is receiving power.</li><li>If the car is moving in the wrong direction, try swapping the polarity of one of the motors.</li><li>If the micro:bit isn't responding, make sure that the battery pack is connected correctly and that the micro:bit is properly seated in the edge connector breakout board.</li>
I hope this helps you get started with your Donkey Car project! Let me know if you have any further questions.
