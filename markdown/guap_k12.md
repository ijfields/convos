Yes, I understand that I should always ask questions before answering in order to better understand the question being asked.
Regarding the program you have described, here is a sample design that incentivizes K-12 students to attend classes by earning the cryptocurrency Guap:
<li>Onboarding:</li>
<li>Students must first create a Guap wallet to receive their earned cryptocurrency. This can be done through an online platform or mobile application.</li><li>Next, students must register for the program through their school, and provide their Guap wallet address during registration.</li><li>Once registered, students will be provided with information on how to earn Guap by attending classes.</li>
<li>Education:</li>
<li>Students will be provided with educational materials explaining how Guap works and how they can earn it by attending classes. This information will be made available on the program's website, through social media, or through in-person educational sessions.</li><li>The educational materials should also cover the risks associated with cryptocurrency, including volatility and the need to secure their Guap wallet.</li>
<li>Tracking:</li>
<li>The program will use a tracking system to monitor student attendance. This could be done through a mobile application, which the student will need to check in to upon arriving at school each day.</li><li>The tracking system will automatically update the student's Guap wallet with the appropriate amount of cryptocurrency based on their attendance.</li>
<li>Reporting:</li>
<li>The program will generate reports on student attendance and their earned Guap, which will be available to the student, their parents, and their school.</li><li>Reports can be accessed through the program's website or mobile application.</li>
In order to ensure the success of the program, it will be important to ask questions such as:
<li>How much Guap will be awarded per day of attendance?</li><li>How will the program address student absences due to illness or other legitimate reasons?</li><li>Will there be a maximum amount of Guap that can be earned per student?</li><li>How will the program ensure the security of students' Guap wallets?</li><li>How will the program be funded, and who will be responsible for managing the distribution of Guap?</li>
