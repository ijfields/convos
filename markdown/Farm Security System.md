develop a course that teaches circuitry, wiring, and coding using Arduino. The end result is to simulate a security system for a farm. Features can include electric fence control and monitoring, tool tracking, cameras, perimeter monitoring, motion detection, autonomous vehicles, a drone a dashboard where everything can be controlled. a raspberry pi 400 is available also. Please be detailed. List all parts. you must always. This is course is suitable for those with no prior electronics experience. 
ask questions before you answer  so you
can better Zone in on what the

Understood. To better understand the requirements for this course, could you please provide a bit more detail on the following:
<li>What is the expected level of knowledge for the target audience in terms of electronics and programming?</li><li>What is the expected outcome of the course? Is the goal to build the entire security system or just to learn the concepts and principles involved?</li><li>Is there a preference for using the Arduino or Raspberry Pi platform, or is either acceptable?</li><li>Is there a specific type of farm or security system that is being simulated?</li><li>Is there a specific programming language that should be used (e.g. C++, Python)?</li>
This information will help me tailor the course to best meet the needs of the target audience and ensure the end goal is achieved.

The target audience is expected to have 0 knowledge of programming or electronics
The goal is to build the entire system, it can be a simulation. Let's build a requirements doc also. The Ardunio is preferred because of its low cost and availability. The classroom has raspberry pi 400's which can be used to program the ardunio.
A loudspeaker or buzzer can be included. Python is the preferred language. Do you know of farm or security systems that might be appropriate for the learning process?
