design me a donkey car based on the micro bit. include a list of parts, where they can be sourced from and detailed instructions with trouble shooting tips

**ChatGPT:**
Sure, I'd be happy to help you design a donkey car based on the micro:bit!
Here is a list of parts you will need:
<li>Micro:bit board</li><li>Micro:bit edge connector breakout board</li><li>Motor driver board (L9110S H-bridge)</li><li>2 x DC motors</li><li>2 x wheels</li><li>Battery pack (4 x AA batteries)</li><li>Jumper wires</li><li>Chassis (can be 3D printed or sourced from a kit)</li>
Here are some suggested sources for these parts:
<li>Micro:bit board and edge connector breakout board: You can buy these from various online stores such as Amazon, Adafruit, and SparkFun.</li><li>Motor driver board (L9110S H-bridge): You can find this on various online stores such as Amazon or Adafruit.</li><li>DC motors and wheels: These can also be found on various online stores such as Amazon, Adafruit, and SparkFun.</li><li>Battery pack: You can find these on Amazon or your local electronics store.</li><li>Jumper wires: These can be found on Amazon or your local electronics store.</li><li>Chassis: You can either 3D print your own chassis or purchase a pre-made kit. There are many different designs available online.</li>
Instructions:
<li><p>First, assemble the chassis according to the instructions provided. This will likely involve attaching the motors to the chassis and securing the wheels to the motor shafts.</p></li><li><p>Next, connect the motor driver board to the micro:bit edge connector breakout board using jumper wires. The motor driver board should be connected to pins 0, 1, 2, and 8 on the breakout board.</p></li><li><p>Connect the DC motors to the motor driver board using jumper wires. Make sure that the polarity is correct.</p></li><li><p>Connect the battery pack to the micro:bit edge connector breakout board using jumper wires. The battery pack should be connected to the 3V and GND pins on the breakout board.</p></li><li><p>Finally, upload the Donkey Car code to the micro:bit board. You can find the code on the official Donkey Car GitHub repository.</p></li>
Troubleshooting tips:
<li>If the motors aren't moving, check to make sure that the jumper wires are connected correctly and that the motor driver board is receiving power.</li><li>If the car is moving in the wrong direction, try swapping the polarity of one of the motors.</li><li>If the micro:bit isn't responding, make sure that the battery pack is connected correctly and that the micro:bit is properly seated in the edge connector breakout board.</li>
I hope this helps you get started with your Donkey Car project! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Certainly! Here are a few options for 3D printable car chassis for your Donkey Car project:
<li><p>Donkey Car Mini: This is a small, compact design that is easy to 3D print and assemble. You can find the STL files for this design on the official Donkey Car GitHub repository.</p></li><li><p>JetRacer: This is a more advanced design that features a sleek, aerodynamic body and a powerful motor. You can find the STL files for this design on the Nvidia Jetson Nano GitHub repository.</p></li><li><p>Tinker Car: This is a simple, yet functional design that can be 3D printed in just a few hours. You can find the STL files for this design on the Tinker Car GitHub repository.</p></li><li><p>Smart Car: This is a larger design that features a spacious interior and plenty of room for customization. You can find the STL files for this design on the Smart Car GitHub repository.</p></li>
All of these designs are compatible with the micro:bit and can be easily customized to fit your specific needs. You can find the STL files for each design on their respective GitHub repositories or on various online 3D printing communities such as Thingiverse.
